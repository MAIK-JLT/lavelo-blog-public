<title>70.3 vs Full Ironman: Which Distance Should You Target First? | Lavelo Triathlon Training</title>
<meta name="keywords" content="ironman, 70.3, race-selection, beginner">
<meta name="description" content="You&rsquo;ve completed a few Olympic distance triathlons. You&rsquo;re hooked. Now you&rsquo;re eyeing the bigger distances, and the question looms: should you jump straight to a full Ironman, or build up through 70.3 first?
It&rsquo;s a decision that will shape the next 6-12 months of your training and racing, so let&rsquo;s break down what you need to know.
The Case for Starting with 70.3
Training Volume Is Manageable
A 70.3 requires roughly 8-12 hours of training per week at peak, compared to 12-18&#43; hours for a full Ironman. If you work full-time and have family commitments, fitting in 10 hours of training is challenging but doable. Fitting in 15-18 hours requires either significant sacrifices or an extremely understanding support system.">

  "articleBody": "You’ve completed a few Olympic distance triathlons. You’re hooked. Now you’re eyeing the bigger distances, and the question looms: should you jump straight to a full Ironman, or build up through 70.3 first?\nIt’s a decision that will shape the next 6-12 months of your training and racing, so let’s break down what you need to know.\nThe Case for Starting with 70.3 Training Volume Is Manageable\nA 70.3 requires roughly 8-12 hours of training per week at peak, compared to 12-18+ hours for a full Ironman. If you work full-time and have family commitments, fitting in 10 hours of training is challenging but doable. Fitting in 15-18 hours requires either significant sacrifices or an extremely understanding support system.\nRace Day Is Less Brutal\nLet’s be honest: a 70.3 hurts, but it’s a manageable hurt. Most age-groupers finish in 5-7 hours. That’s a hard day, but it’s not the physical and mental demolition that can occur during hours 7-14 of a full Ironman. You’re far less likely to find yourself in a dark place wondering why you signed up for this.\nFaster Learning Curve\nYou’ll make mistakes in your first long-course race. That’s guaranteed. Maybe you go out too hard on the bike. Maybe your nutrition strategy falls apart. Maybe you didn’t practice your transitions enough. With a 70.3, these mistakes are educational but not devastating. Make the same mistakes in a full Ironman, and you might find yourself walking the marathon in serious pain.\nMore Opportunities to Race\nThere are far more 70.3 races than full Ironman events, and they’re spread throughout the season. This means you can race 2-3 times per year, learning and improving with each race. Full Ironman athletes typically race once, maybe twice per year.\nLess Injury Risk\nThe training volume for a full Ironman significantly increases injury risk, particularly if you don’t have years of base endurance built up. A 70.3 training plan is still challenging, but the lower volume gives your body more recovery time.\nThe Case for Going Straight to Ironman If You’re Already Doing the Volume\nIf you’re a runner who regularly logs 40+ miles per week, or a cyclist crushing 10+ hour weeks, or you come from another endurance sport background, you might already have the aerobic base for Ironman training. In this case, the jump to full Ironman training volume isn’t as dramatic.\nThe Distance Calls to You\nSome people don’t just want to do an Ironman—they need to do it. If that’s you, if the full distance is what drew you to triathlon in the first place, then go for it. Just be smart about it. Hire a coach, follow a structured plan, and respect the distance.\nYou Have the Time\nIf you’re in a life situation where you can dedicate 15-20 hours per week to training without sacrificing your job, relationships, or mental health, then the full Ironman is realistic. But be honest with yourself about this. Most people overestimate how much time they really have.\nWhat the Data Says Looking at Ironman and 70.3 results, some interesting patterns emerge:\nAge-group athletes who do a 70.3 first typically:\nHave faster full Ironman debut times Are less likely to DNF their first full Ironman Report higher satisfaction with their first full Ironman experience Are more likely to do multiple Ironman races Athletes who jump straight to full Ironman:\nHave higher DNF rates in their debut Often take longer to recover post-race More commonly report the experience as “survival mode” rather than “racing” This doesn’t mean you can’t be successful jumping straight in—plenty of athletes are. But the statistics lean toward building through 70.3.\nA Practical Progression Here’s a reasonable progression for someone coming from Olympic distance:\nYear 1:\n2-3 Olympic distance races Build weekly training volume to 8-10 hours Year 2:\nOne 70.3 race (mid-season) Maintain 10-12 hour training weeks Learn race-day nutrition and pacing at distance Year 3:\nFull Ironman OR another 70.3 to nail the race execution If going full Ironman, peak at 15-18 hour weeks This progression allows your body to adapt gradually, reduces injury risk, and gives you multiple learning opportunities before tackling the full distance.\nThe Financial Reality Let’s talk money. A 70.3 race typically costs $300-450 to enter. A full Ironman runs $650-850+. Add in travel, accommodation, bike maintenance, nutrition products, and potential coaching fees, and a full Ironman season can easily cost $3,000-5,000+.\nIf you’re going to invest that much money and time, doesn’t it make sense to build up to it rather than risk a DNF or miserable experience?\nRed Flags: When You’re Not Ready Don’t attempt a full Ironman if:\nYou’ve never completed a 70.3 You can’t consistently train 10+ hours per week You have unresolved injury issues Your longest run is still under 90 minutes Your longest ride is under 3 hours You haven’t practiced race-day nutrition in training The Bottom Line For 90% of athletes, starting with 70.3 is the smarter choice. It’s challenging enough to be meaningful, manageable enough to be sustainable, and educational enough to properly prepare you for the full distance if you choose to go there.\nThat said, if you’re experienced in endurance sports, have the time and support system, and the full distance genuinely calls to you, then go for it. Just be smart, be patient, and respect the distance.\nRemember: Ironman isn’t going anywhere. The race will still be there next year, and the year after that. There’s no rush. Build your foundation, learn the ropes at 70.3, then step up to the full distance when you’re truly ready.\nYour future self—standing on that Ironman finish line—will thank you for being patient.\n",

<p>Looking at Ironman and 70.3 results, some interesting patterns emerge:</p>
<p><strong>Age-group athletes who do a 70.3 first typically</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have faster full Ironman debut times</li>
<li>Are less likely to DNF their first full Ironman</li>
<li>Report higher satisfaction with their first full Ironman experience</li>
<li>Are more likely to do multiple Ironman races</li>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a reasonable progression for someone coming from Olympic distance:</p>
<p><strong>Year 1</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>2-3 Olympic distance races</li>
<li>Build weekly training volume to 8-10 hours</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Year 2</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>One 70.3 race (mid-season)</li>
<li>Maintain 10-12 hour training weeks</li>
<li>Learn race-day nutrition and pacing at distance</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Year 3</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full Ironman OR another 70.3 to nail the race execution</li>
<li>If going full Ironman, peak at 15-18 hour weeks</li>
</ul>
<p>This progression allows your body to adapt gradually, reduces injury risk, and gives you multiple learning opportunities before tackling the full distance.</p>

<p>For 90% of athletes, starting with 70.3 is the smarter choice. It&rsquo;s challenging enough to be meaningful, manageable enough to be sustainable, and educational enough to properly prepare you for the full distance if you choose to go there.</p>
<p>That said, if you&rsquo;re experienced in endurance sports, have the time and support system, and the full distance genuinely calls to you, then go for it. Just be smart, be patient, and respect the distance.</p>
<p>Remember: Ironman isn&rsquo;t going anywhere. The race will still be there next year, and the year after that. There&rsquo;s no rush. Build your foundation, learn the ropes at 70.3, then step up to the full distance when you&rsquo;re truly ready.</p>
<p>Your future self—standing on that Ironman finish line—will thank you for being patient.</p>
