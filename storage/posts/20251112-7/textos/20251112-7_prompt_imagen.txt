# IMPROVED PROMPT

Create a dynamic illustration of a triathlon athlete's mind in action, rendered with photographic quality and a close-up perspective that emphasizes intimate detail. The composition is square-formatted, designed to draw viewers directly into the subject matter with macro-level precision.

**Left Side - The Mind:**
A glowing brain with neural pathways lighting up in electric blue and purple, representing mental processes and the "central governor." Capture this in sharp macro focus using studio lighting that creates clean, defined shadows and highlights. The neural connections should appear three-dimensional and tactile against a dark background.

**Right Side - The Athlete:**
A determined triathlete mid-race (swimming, cycling, running simultaneously or transitioning), rendered in warm tones that complement studio lighting. The athlete should be in sharp close-up focus, with photographic realism capturing muscle definition and concentrated expression. Dynamic positioning shows intensity while maintaining clarity.

**Symbolic Elements with Close-up Treatment:**
- A glowing heart representing mental strength, positioned prominently with macro-level detail
- Visualization clouds above the athlete's head, rendered with warm tones and matte texture
- Positive affirmations floating in the air, crisp and readable with studio-lit clarity
- A calm color gradient transitioning from intense warm orange/red (stress) to cool blue (control), maintaining warm tone dominance through studio lighting

**Visual Treatment:**
- **Lighting:** Professional studio lighting creating clean contrasts, even illumination on focal points, and subtle shadows that add dimensionality
- **Style:** Photorealistic with illustrative elements seamlessly integrated
- **Texture:** Matte finish throughout, avoiding glossy reflections
- **Color Palette:** Warm tones dominating (golden yellows, warm oranges, burnt siennas) balanced with electric blues and purples for contrast
- **Quality:** Photographic quality with sharp focus, clear details, and professional precision

**Modern, scientific aesthetic with motivational undertones.** High contrast and inspiring mood maintained through selective focus and dramatic studio lighting. Clean, professional design suitable for sports psychology content.

**Bold Typography:** Feature key concepts like "Mental Resilience" and "Performance Potential" in sharp, legible typefaces that maintain focus clarity in the square composition.

**Technical Specifications:**
- Square aspect ratio for balanced composition
- Macro lens perspective emphasizing intricate details
- Studio lighting setup for professional, controlled atmosphere
- Matte surface quality with warm color grading
- Photographic sharpness with illustrative artistic elements
- Close-up framing that creates intimate psychological connection

The overall aesthetic combines scientific accuracy with motivational inspiration, using warm studio-lit tones and macro-level detail to create an immersive, photorealistic depiction of athletic mental performance.
